# üè° Real Estate Sales Dashboard & Price Prediction (2001‚Äì2022)

This project presents a complete data analytics and visualization pipeline for 20 years of real estate sales data. It includes a **Power BI dashboard**, **SQL queries for business insights**, and a **machine learning model** to predict housing prices based on historical data.

---

## üìä Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze real estate sales trends from 2001 to 2022 using AWS services and visualize key business insights. Additionally, a Python model has been built to predict house prices using the same dataset.

## üìà Power BI Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI report includes:
- Year-over-year sales volume and average price
- Property types and price distribution
- Sale trends by location and square footage
- Heatmaps and bar charts for performance comparison

> **Note:** You need Power BI Desktop to open the `.pbix` file.

## üß† Query Logic (`RealEstateQueries.docx`)

The SQL queries include:
- Total transactions per year
- Average sale price by year and location
- Top 5 cities by price growth
- Price trend by property type
- Seasonal pattern analysis (quarterly trends)

These queries were run using **Amazon Athena** on data stored in **Amazon S3**, cataloged with **AWS Glue**.

---

## üßÆ Price Prediction Script (`real_estate.py`)

This Python script:
- Loads the cleaned dataset
- Preprocesses data (feature engineering, handling missing values)
- Splits into training and testing sets
- Trains a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression / RandomForest)
- Predicts house price based on input features like date, area, year built, etc.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 and the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
python real_estate.py
